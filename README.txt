PlayFab SDK for Objective-C Beta
========
1. Overview:
This is our Objective-C SDK for native OSX & iOS development. This SKD is currently in beta, so please let us know if you run into any issues. 

Happy Developing!

2. Usage Instructions:
----
There are two ways to get started:
  1. Start with and add to our [example implemnetation project](/Objective_C_SDK/ExampleProject)
  2. Import [our SDK](/Objective_C_SDK/PlayFabSDK) into an existing XCode project

3. PlayFab Configuration:
----
Set your PlayFab TitleId in PlayFabSettings.m, on the line:
```Objective-C
  static NSString * TitleId = @"XXXX";
```

4. Making an API request and receiving the response:
----
```Objective-C
//EXAMPLE: Login with custom id request:

//Build the Request object:
  LoginWithCustomIDRequest* login_request = [LoginWithCustomIDRequest new];
  login_request.CustomId = [[[UIDevice currentDevice] identifierForVendor] UUIDString]; //use the identifier for vendor as our custom ID.
  login_request.CreateAccount = true; //creates a new account if no existing one
    
//Make each call to [PlayFabClientAPI GetInstance], the first time you do this, an instance will be created and then used.
  [[PlayFabClientAPI GetInstance] LoginWithCustomID:login_request
      
      success:^(LoginResult* result, NSObject* userData) {
        //This block will run when we receive successful response, inspect the result class for pertinent info.
        NSLog(@"error %@",result.PlayFabId);
      }

      failure:^(PlayFabError *error, NSObject *userData) {
        //Request errored or failed to connect, inspect the PlayFabError class for pertinent info.
        NSLog(@"error %@",error.description);
      } withUserData:nil];
```


5. Other Notes:
----
IDFA/advertisingIdentifier logic is present but has not been properly tested.
Is off by default, only available if you explicitly add USE_IDFA=1 to Target > Build Settings > Preprocessor Macros.

testTitleData.json is present in project but must be changed to valid data for any Unit Tests to work.
